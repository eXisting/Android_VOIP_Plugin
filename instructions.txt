This instruction describes steps of creating Android plugin (Unity3d based).

Task:
Need to implement plugin that will show some UI (Activity) on Firebase OnMessageReceived method triggered
in all device states (inactive, enabled, etc.) and connect that to Unity via unity.jar library file and send message to UnityActivity

Implementation:
1. Create empty application Android project
2. Add new Android library module with package name equal to that you use inside your unity project (my case)
3. Add repository files to src folder (google-services.json from Firebase is required)
	- add required libraries
	- change project gradle to include google dependencies
	- change module gradle to have build deependencies
4. Sync gradle
5. Make *.aar files by Gradle -> Build -> Build (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43358536/unity-ignores-android-plugin-manifest-file-leading-to-missing-service-element)

UNITY REQUIRED STEPS FROM HERE

6. Open .arr file as archive
7. Remove libs folder from it
8. Save and add to Assets/Plugins/Android folder (WARNING! Add it to root folder and not wrap it into folders)
9. Change main unity AndroidManifest to include used classes:

<!--WARNING: THESE LINES ARE REQUIRED BY VoIP PLUGIN FOR ANDROID
DO NOT REMOVE THEM UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!-->
    <service android:name=".VoIPMessagingService" android:exported="false">
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
      </intent-filter>
    </service>
    <activity android:name=".CallActivity" />
<!--End-->

10. Provide custom gradle build file to include layout dependencies (implementation 'com.android.support.constraint:constraint-layout:1.1.3')

You are done.
